### Hi there 👋

I am a passionate programmer focused on the field of video games. I am very close to getting an associate degree in Video Game Design and Programming at Universidad Nacional del Litoral (Argentina). I also got an associate degree as Programmer Analyst at “Instituto Urquiza”. I have been teaching programming and IT for 30 years. I discovered programming when I was 15 and since then I haven't stopped learning and improving, in fact, I consider I'm in my best moment. In my free time, I love walking, reading, and spending time with my family.
